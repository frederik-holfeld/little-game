# little-game

A little, currently deprecated experiment about evolutionary simulation starring round blobs. Run using a canvas and JavaScript. Main functionality is missing at the moment. Iâ€™m probably going to try and implement the simulation itself in Rust for speed from now on and use this only as the front end.

Tested using Brave web browser.
